## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:


1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the repo and create your branch from the default branch.
   
   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd <repo-name>
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upsteam-owner>/<repo-name>

   # Update the upstream
   git checkout <default-branch>
   git pull upstream <default-branch>

   # Create your feature / fix branch
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Commit your changes, see [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
7. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch.
   
    ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

8. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.


## Development

### Setup you local environment.

1. Ensure you have the Node.js version we use, check [.npmrc](.npmrc). You can easily run multiple Node version with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

2. Install dependencies `npm install`

3. See the `package.json` how to run the test.

4. Run the CLI locally 

   ```bash
   npm run dev src/cli.ts <options>
   ```

### Adding tests

Please provide tests for your contribution.

To generate a new fixture for Markdown output run

```bash
./lib/cli.js --no-banner -a __tests__/fixtures/<action>.yml | \ 
  tail -r | tail -n +2 | tail -r > <action_md>.output
```

For creating a README.md fixture, first create the readme input file for the test, and copy the same file to the an output file. Next run the following command to update the output which can be used to verify the test.


```bash
./lib/cli.js --no-banner -a __tests__/fixtures/<action>.yml -u __tests_/fixtures/<readme>.output
```

### Use a Consistent Coding Style

- we use spaces.
- You can try running `npm run lint && npm run format` for style unification
